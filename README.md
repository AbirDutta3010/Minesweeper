# Minesweeper
A simple game, made using Java Swing, based on the concept of the old popular game Minesweeper. It is not entirely like the Minesweeper game, but the concept is more or less same. To run the code, simply copy paste the code on any Java IDE and run it, or rename the file to .java extension and then run it.
